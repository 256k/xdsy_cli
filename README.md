# X days since Y
a commnad line tool to keep track of a list of entries and how many days has gone since each entry was entered.

This is inspired by my successful endavour to quit smoking. One of the major helpers was keeping track of how many days have gone by since I last smoked. the more days would accumulate the more I was encouraged to not break the streak until I finally broke the habbit and addiction entirely. It's been over 3 years since I last smoked.
